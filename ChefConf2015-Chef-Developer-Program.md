This conversation came out of a recent event where a resource/DSL was added to core Chef that collided with Chef Sugar. Unhappiness ensued. 

Suggestion: 
+ Register yourself as a "Chef Developer"
  + Get notifications of release/updates/changes?
  + Participants in this program would have their libraries or cookbooks included in Chef(TM) test suites?

Concern about Chef testing the world
What happens if a plugin breaks? Does this stop chef being released? 
How would we know what to test?

Ideas
+ Chef changes mailing list - when we do nightly builds the pipeline could generate this
+ Dashboard for integration testing
+ ressurect chef-dev mailing list for communication to developers
+ buildkite for PR integration tests

Chef Software needs to get better at internally notifying relevant developers

Releases.chef.io as a historical view of all releases and nightlies
