Certification programs!
+ George Miranda proposed
  + runs the partnership program
  + individual cert program grew out of partnership program
  + partnership cert program was very intensive, hands-on
+ Example: RedHat certiffied Engineer
  + general training
  + application training on things like mysql, Java stack or similar
  + exam
+ What is meaningful / useful?
  + Most people have not found them to be useful except as a quailifier for sales
  + Splunk Architect exam:
    + 24 hour test
    + customer assessment followed by design + implementation
    + proctor as customer
    + significant washout rate
    + scoring is designed to allow weaknesses in one part, but not tolerate two
    + After build, they break it, watch you fix it
    + Exam process is resource-intensive, but is $1000 out of pocket
  + VMware cert exam
    + all multiple choice exam - $225
    + instructior-led training required - $3000 - seems like a money-grab, but it shows a commitment to it
  + Should cost be a barrier?
    + if you take a course, perhaps you get 1 free re-exam
    + if no course, challenge-mode, no free retake
  + AWS devops cert
    + George took it for competitive analysis
    + multiple choice, highly nuanced questions
    + difficult, required deep knowledge
  + Item design - multiple choice with all/none of the above - can make a multiple choice exam adequately challenging
    + can have multiple correct answers
    + or weighted correct answers
+ Platform for practical lab-work exercises?
+ What is to be covered? - Modularity?
  + What does a cert mean if you can pick ala cart for the modules?
    + Redhat has 18 modules, pick 6 or 8 
    + An individual who can do 6 of the things can likely pick up any other module pretty quickly
    + Most cert programs have a cert lookup website which allows us to lookup modules earned based on 
  + Chef for windows?
  + Orchestratration
  + Testing?
  + Plugin development?
+ Why certification program?
  + Need came From the professional services group - customers wanted long-term engagement
  + Chef wants to hand off to partners, but give customers confidence that the partner is chef-approved
  + Can be used for career advancement
  + Can be used for recruitment / screening
  + Many individuals do not see value
    + Valuable for people with non-CS/STEM degrees
+ Protection against devaluation?
  + Modularity?
  + Continuing ed?
  + Expiration in the cert name?
  + Points towards partnership - employer incentive to maintain certs to keep partnership 
+ How prescriptive?
  + Knowing chef and chef tools vs knowing "the chef way"
  + practical exams would have to grade as "many ways to skin a cat, just don't do it using all execute resources"
+ Binary failure?
  + RHCE vs RHDE - one exam, but if you score (say) 75% you get Desktop certification, if you clear (say) 90% you get Server cert
+ Rubric
  + Critical fails
  + making a practical test that is fast to evaluate
  + Splunk forced fast evaluation by having all people take it - could not scale unless it was testable
  + CAT?  questions increase in difficulty as you progresss, if you get it wrong it give you easier questions
+ Test prep ?
  + Running a text editor?
  + command prompt?
  + "We recommend that you have exposure to the following:... learnchef will help"
  + Recommended time gap between basic and intermediate level certs
