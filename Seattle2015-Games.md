* Hinabi (card game) - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hanabi_(card_game)

Hanabi is a cooperative card game in which players, aware of other players' cards but not their own, attempt to play a series of cards in a specific order to set off a simulated fireworks show. Players are limited in the types of information they may give to other players, and in the total amount of information that can be given during the game. In 2013, Hanabi won the Spiel des Jahres, a prestigious industry award for best board game of the year.

## Implementation

Choose a time in the work schedule. This is important to fueling the culture of the team.
Choose games that do not eliminate or hinder the player
Include it in Standup that simply engage the individuals on your team 
Have a champion that knows, leads and teaches the game
Not all people need to play and may feel more comfortable watching the game
Play a game a few times before moving on to the next game
Schedule a few games but leave that open to more players
Make the game playing when you hire new people to get to know them
Play a game with the people you interview
Be respectful of where you place the games and designated as the gaming space. It should be close to feed the culture but not so close that it distracts from the work (e.g. the ping pong table close to desks)

What about when a team that is playing games fails to deliver on a milestone?

Look at the team and not at the game.
