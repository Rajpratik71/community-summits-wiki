Balancing OS contribution when working for $company

Jeff - open

## Balancing

Nick - Balancing don't want to give away game changing stuff, due to competitive advantage.  What's the balance?  What to keep secret and balance?

Techies want to talk about it, but business.

Made something better?  Contribute back so don't have to maintain separate fork.  Company doesn't have to keep everything open source, can pick and choose.  Take it to other powers?

Nordstrom got permission to contribute cookbooks and chef stuff.  Legal may need to be involved.

Questions exist about why a company would do this?  Eco system argument, there are books.

Another benefit - recruiting tool. Strong folks might require to be able to contribute and present.

Jennifer - Open sourcing helps reduce technical debt.  When people share, more folks contribute and help make stuff better.

Folks have been fired for open sourcing something - get permission and think throught the license choice.  GPL needed to be confirmed.

Other side to technical debt, commit to support in some sense.  Coding in the open, the government can't accept the licenses.  You do need to understand the licenses.  Everyone's corporate licenses are afraid of GPL licenses.  Black Duck is code to scan repo's. Don't just open it up, have a license.


Doug - recommend Apache 2 License for Nordstrom stuff.  Brand protections that MIT and BSD don't offer.

## Getting Started
How hard is it to contribute?  Slap a license on it and go - YOLO.  
+ Types of contributions.
+ Contribution - chef,
+ OSS project
+ Just publish on github - not recommended

Are you signing up to support something for life?
+ Need to find successor.
+ Depends if a community sprouts up
+ Guilt - feels bad about tickets
+ README - be clear about support level
+ Chef vault - scary who supports it.  Added to chef-dk and the commitment is real. Responsibility feeling is real.
+ Berkshelf - At Riot, folks left how does it get submitted.
+ Not super awesome to just dump code?  You can read it, but having support and a community is better? But checking something compiles and generally works is sort of a minimum.
+ Turn off pull requests if you won't take them.
   
How do you do open source in a big company?  There are issues.
Are you working on something on company time does the company own it?

Example of submit - fix small things to get started.

Open source - only if care about it in a positive way.
Decide how you want to govern something.  Is it mine only, can other folks commit, changes accepted.  Be clear with yourself.



Why they exist?  CLA a layer on top of license, giving extra permissions.  Like the right to distribute without attribution.  Chef does not do copywrite assignment.  Some CLAs give up  the copywrite.  Patents can be a really big deal. Research and talk to lawyers.  Check your employee handbook.
