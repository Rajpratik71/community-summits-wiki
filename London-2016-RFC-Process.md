RFC Process
Confusing amount of involement:
    Great way to get involved.
    But you must get involved?

Trying to stop people just asking for new features without helping get them into Chef.

CGGB recommended that the proposer should market the RFC in the channels, and raise visibility/partification.

Possibly change to the RFC process to include this.


What about the other tools in the ecosystem? Berks, ChefDK etc
The only reason this isn't done right now seems to be that because no one has submitted one.
Possibly ChefDK and it's tools are included? But maybe we should clear this up as a community.
RFC'ing tools that are not Chef tools makes it harder.

Over the time it's been runnning, what makes a good RFC?
What about RFCs that haven't been really implemented?
The BIG RFCs are hard to implement, smaller discrete changes are easier to implement.
A good RFC is often one that comes out with a community decision.

What the RFC process is:
    Modeled on the RFC https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Request_for_Comments
    Making significant change in Chef

Describing the RFC process https://github.com/tas50/chef-rfc/blob/master/rfc000-rfc-process.md

Historically what goes into Chef gets community discussion and buy in.
