Discussed the RFC process https://github.com/chef/chef-rfc/blob/master/rfc000-rfc-process.md

Review what is currently visible in the supermarket that indicates what CI state is, if any.

Goal is to create a minimal RFC that is just about providing some sort of indication that there are tests and they are being running.

Working up the RFC now, with a working title of "Supermarket testing indicators"

Focusing just on the status indicator now. Trying to stay away from notions of quality and coverage as the first is highly subjective and the second is quantitative but suggests qualitative judgement.

At minimum having a visual indicator would be a big step forward so that's where we are focused for now.

There was a discussion about MUST vs SHOULD and the desire to not use SHOULD

@martinisoft has a fork of the rfc repo and is writing the first draft.
