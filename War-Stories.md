A session for sharing war stories from the field.

[CONTENT REDACTED FOR JOB SECURITY]

In all seriousness, outside of some fun back and forth with stories that are probably best kept ephemeral, there was great conversation around best practices and teambuilding. In particular how to get teams past the "I can't do this" early stages, and justify the practices set by ensuring they fit not only a single team's, but a full organization's goals. Interestingly, there's a lot of overlap there, as more than one horror story ended up being the catalyst for spurring automation, to provide away to protect against similar issues in the future.
