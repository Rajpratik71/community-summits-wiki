We discussed about the fact there is usually a secrets talk and why. This is a long running problem space because solutions are usually very bespoke and tightly driven to people's use case.

Chef-Vault is an easy and fast solution with a quick spin up for chef users but has issues with autoscaling. It also binds secrets add & update to Chef run instead of application space. There is also a data race with multi user editing.

Hashicorp Vault is a popular solution. It now has an agent to help with Authentication

Habitat has an encrypted ring to store secrets but populating it is manual and it doesn't sanely persist, so if the ring goes down it will need to be rebuilt.

Do you have file secrets? As a tip write them to a FIFO! This makes the secret read once. However your application needs to haqndle FIFOs properly and not hang waiting for more data on them.

Provisioning w/ credentials was discussed, most people had a bespoke use case to their very specific layout but most agreed it's a generally problematic thing. You want to be able to scale dynamically and use an automated tooling to set things up, but how you authenticate those things is a problem.

Those with chef-vault would do the bootstrap with no run list, then add it and re-run chef, (double run).
Using Hashicorp Vault Agent, Terraform, and KMS was discussed for those who use AWS.

It was brought up if InSpec has auditing for Hasicorp Vault as well as Chef-Vault and even the Chef Server. The answer came back no for all of these but there is interest in getting it written.
