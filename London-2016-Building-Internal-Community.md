Discussion on building an internal community to spread the use of new tooling or approach

Some participants : Scott Russell and Richard Nixon from the Chef Transformation team .  Ian Henry from Chef Community team.

OW shared how in their organisation, where the size of the technical teams are growing fast, there are a lot of external consultants working on the team, there is a challenge to make sure things are always done in the same way

Challenge to balance improvements in exection against culture... discussion that changes in culture alone dont impact excution improvements.  In fact, changes in culture can cause drops in execution ("disruption" - not necessarily a good thing!)  Q: how do you stop the slide when you are on the cultural change path?. How do you break down the barriers between the different teams?  Or ensure that they are aligned culturally? especially when people are not co located.

Senior management may want to change to an Agile or DevOps 'model' but the teams delivering are not on board.  Suggestion - create 1 multi disciplined team to implement the model to be the showcase... Need to demonstrate the value in this (e.g. find the app that has relatviely low impact that hasn't changed in forever, but a lot of people use and create a team around this made up of dev, security, storage, QA etc.  This single team exist virtually and still have their current role but can be used to demonstrate the impact.    Q: How does this scale?

Find the few people that are excited by what you have done and use them to spread the success of the changes.  Challenge to keep up wtih the expectation / focus of the senior management team in scenario when this initiative was first launched.

Chef approach is to find a small project that will last around 8 weeks and will find a single outcome that is based on a hypothesis (we want to improve xxx) Chef will mentor the teams and monitor progress.. and they find that the first 2 weeks are chaotic, the next 2 weeks are challenging as pepole learn their new roles and do believe that the project will never be a success.  It takes until 6 weeks in to get to the point at which it starts working.  All the way through demo what they have learnt (even if this is not a successful thing)

It is very important to deliver an outcome in a short space of time (so set the goal for delivery relatively low)  And to provide feedback on a regular basis so that progress can be visible.

Accept that people and cultural problems are the hardest problems to solve but there is a difference in the scale e.g. 1 person can be the blocker in a 500 person team in the same way that 1 person can also be in a small team.

Don't try to restructure an organisation e.g. to avoid having to deal with a particular team who are always considered the blocker.  Back to forming the small cross functional teams across the silos - size of team will vary wtih size of organisation.

Include people from outside of the 'normal' team e.g. include someone from Compliance who may become the biggest advocate.

Experience from CapitalOne - it needed the influence of senior people who ensured that the cross functional teams could be formed  But sill challenges of working in such a big organsiation and having to accept that progress is slow.  Make sure you publicise the sucesses!
