-- Learn chef start is great, but there's no real world examples.

- Onboarding new people...is hard. People won't do the modules in learn Chef.

-- I have to learn Ruby, no experience in Ruby. Show me a way to bring them all together, let me do something end to end. End-to-end like capstone.

- The modules have type-o's and misconfiguration. Overall quality, type-o's.

-- Need an atlas to ecosystem, -relationship of components.

- how to think of Chef's role conceptually.

-- Hashicorp doc style is awesome.

- Take down anything that is before Chef 12 please.

-- Show me patterns and how they relate to each other. Why would I use this pattern vs why wouldn't I use this pattern?

- First piece of info I'm looking for...what is Chef? Chef server? Chef Solo?

-- Canonical Chef - knife-solo/knife-zero

- Debugging a failed chef client run...how to?

-- How do I download a cookbook? Give us deprecations warning, and telling people how to do this (use berkshelf)- would be nice.

- One of the hardest thing to bootstrap...is the Chef server, would be great to just get a button to get a bash/python script that it spits out and you can bootstrap.

-- Dynamically generated run lists vs roles...the highlevel choose your own adventure style patterns would be nice..
