* Where to use Chef and/or DSC?
* You can use Chef to orchestrate the DSC
* Performance "depends" - not necessarily just timing, but perf impact
* How do you test when you have domain requirements?  Longer lived test domains, cloud templates and the proxy driver.
* How do you shorten the update cycle - MDT and WDS or DISM offline patching
* Custom powershell script to apply patches
* Server core can reduce the number of patches
* Application installs/automation with chef vs habitat

* 700 Windows VMs - Lots of old Applications - Want to manage the Infrastructure more than application layer as there are older applications around which is difficult to automate

* Looking at an instance of PowerShell in memory within Ruby but this is a side project due to requiring more customer feedback

* Proxy driver - Not well known of but ships in box within the kitchen project
