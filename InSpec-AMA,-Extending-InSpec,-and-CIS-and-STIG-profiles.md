 	- Martez Reed, GCP contributor (hooray!)
- Need: clear migration examples for serverspec
    - conceptual?
    - incremenatal adoption?
    - how profiles interact
- Need: Clear collaboration story
    - how to store profiles
    - how to isolate concerns
    - how dependencies can be used for collaboration, similar to cookbooks
- Polls:
    - New to inspec? 20%
    - Use inspec for cookbook testing?  20%
    - Use inspec for compliance? 15%
    - Looking to integrate inspec with another product? 5% 

- Nessus vs inspec
- STIG - need STIG for FedRamp
- Should we connect chef and inspec?
  - Chef will probably not do this for two reasons:
    - need to keep inspec and chef codebases separate
    - what are you testing if you let the configurator drive the auditor?
  - It is a useful idea in some cases and a project from the community would be welcome
- GPO resources for windows - badly needed
- anything coming for vmware, cisco, f5?
  - stay tuned!
