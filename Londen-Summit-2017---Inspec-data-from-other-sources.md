> Inspec will be better in scanning API endpoints.
> Currently it is node bound, it will grow bond the node.
> Where you will be able to scan AWS/Azure.

> There is an issue 1661 (https://github.com/chef/inspec/issues/1661), it's an RFC.
> It's on the milestone for Inspec 2.0

> Automate need to be updates as well to display this new data.
> Remote and local data need to be virtualised. This needs more work.
> Expected to be in Automate 2.0 stack.

> There will be new query structure so you have better options for search/query.
> There needs to be work done on the virtualisation. There are ideas out there, but nothing concrete yet.
