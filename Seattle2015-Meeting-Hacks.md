# Meeting Hacks
## Session Format
[Liberating Structures](http://www.liberatingstructures.com/) is a set of techniques for facilitating group learning. We used three of these for the Meeting Hacks session:
+ [Impromptu Networking](http://www.liberatingstructures.com/2-impromptu-networking/)
+ [TRIZ](http://www.liberatingstructures.com/6-making-space-with-triz/)
+ [1-2-4-All](http://www.liberatingstructures.com/1-1-2-4-all/)
## Session Notes
### Sharing Goals
First the group used Impromptu Networking to talk with each other, asking: "What do you want from meetings?"
### Choosing What to Do
Next the group worked through a TRIZ exercise to understand what keeps meetings from delivering value and identify changes each individual can make to help bring value. Folks went through three rounds of 1-2-4-All, each focused on a different question
#### Round 1: How to Make a Terrible Meeting
The group identified what they could do to make a meeting as terrible as possible. This included:
+ Personal attacks
+ Rampant pessimism
+ No eye contact
+ Multi-tasking
+ Right fight (I'm right and I won't stop until you understand that I'm right)
+ Lock the door (mandatory meetings)
+ Non-committal "yes" responses
+ Non-critical "yes" responses
+ Ignorance & apathy
+ Agression
+ Silence
+ Monopolizing
+ Side bars
#### Round 2: Which of These Do We Already Do
The group talked about which of the ways of making meetings terrible they already do, and what that looks like.
#### Round 3: What Can We Stop?
The group took time to think about the meeting they have least power over, and what they can stop doing that harms these meetings and how they can help others stop.
+ Stop multi-tasking, push the keyboard away, turn off your devices or don't bring them
+ Say "no" to unclear requests and/or ask for more information
+ Raise concerns about bad ideas, ask questions; if necessary, request to follow up later
+ Provide negative feedback in a positive light; Call attention to what is right about the thing before talking about what is wrong about it
+ Generate healthy conflict
+ No personal or meaningless attacks
+ The compliment sandwich (praise something, offer criticism, more praise), but don't let it turn into a shit sandwich
+ The law of mobility: If you are not contributing to the conversation and are not getting what you need from it, leave
+ Decline invites for meetings you don't need to attend, with a nice note to explain why
