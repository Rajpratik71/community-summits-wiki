chris-rock: what is a report to you? everyone has a different idea of what that means.

Markus:
usually periodic audits are just about that auditor look at a whole pile of documents & only if something "appears" wrong will they start digging into it.
example: manually create a big Excel sheet and put a manager's signature on it, done! :-)

hmmm... rather than filling in stupid Excel sheets day-to-day then they can do some real work.

InSpec - easy to get started, but what do you do with the output. you don't want to show the code but merely the results. for example the graphs and things in Chef Automate. higher-level people don't have Wi-Fi say on the train, they like to read paper documents and annotate them, just look into it later.

Markus' company does genome research & capture information about it. e.g. that genome analysis was correct. and need to keep that history for a very long time, say ten years. the consumers of these outputs aren't digital & don't have access to our network.

Chris - how would you distribute these data to your consumers of it?
Markus - what I would like is to run these daily tests that is the snapshot of state. personally I like the exporters -- thanks Jared Quick? -- there's an HTML exporter but its output is ugly. (Chris - it's inherited from RSpec so yeah...) but it's a great start.

It would be nice for the report to have our logo on top, the date.
