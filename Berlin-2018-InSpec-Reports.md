chris-rock: what is a report to you? everyone has a different idea of what that means.

Markus:
usually periodic audits are just about that auditor look at a whole pile of documents & only if something "appears" wrong will they start digging into it.
example: manually create a big Excel sheet and put a manager's signature on it, done! :-)

hmmm... rather than filling in stupid Excel sheets day-to-day then they can do some real work.

InSpec - easy to get started, but what do you do with the output. you don't want to show the code but merely the results. for example the graphs and things in Chef Automate. higher-level people don't have Wi-Fi say on the train, they like to read paper documents and annotate them, just look into it later.
