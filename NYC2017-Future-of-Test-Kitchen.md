See https://github.com/chef/community-summits/wiki/Seattle2017-Future-of-Test-Kitchen for the previous discussion.

## New "near" Item

debug mode from CLI

## Lifecycle Hooks

Could power post-build webhooks

## Caching story?

* kitchen-vagrant caches boxes and (sometimes) chef installers
* dokken caches via docker image system
* we should document how to set up local squid to cache for TK

## Document the whole testing ecosystem better

* should better explain where to use chefspec
* explain kitchen vs. inspec
