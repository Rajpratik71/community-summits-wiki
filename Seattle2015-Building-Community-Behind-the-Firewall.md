Introducers: Jessica and Josh O'Brien

DevOps is People, with some tools attached.
Companies that build the community do well, others struggle.

Trend of making large companies feel like small ones and visa-versa has had some success

define - 'Safety in Meetings'
+ Getting people to feel like they can talk to each other and break down silo's etc.
+ Creating an environment where vulnumility is encouraged and good for business.
+ Feeling safe to say 'hey I need help with this'

Community behind the firewall and creating safety - want positive ideas of how to build culture.

What is safety?
   Jessica - observed isolated people at meeting and saw transformation to peer programming and engaged folks. By creating a safe space.
   Josh - Creating an environment where vulnerability is ok, high trust and safe. 
   Cameron - Different examples of safety, blameless postmortems, encourage hiding problems because folks don't want to be blamed.
   Justin - points out the strategic advantage.

Justin - Tools set up to isolate too much, chat is an example. Present in rooms and persistent chat programs  help. It's a mass thing, get useful information into the room.
Group Chat with history, with a dedicated room that allows for discussion and sharing of information helps enable people to be empowered.

Irving - big blank spaces don't work. Don't set up tools with no content.

Nathan - tools probably not a good start, be in a room if possible.

If highlevel decision makers refuse to be part of the community that can be fatal, but if they go in first that leadership can be useful.

Change small things, ie we have a new project, lets push community with this project, this can then spread around the whole business

Remeber it's people that you are talking to, so talk about things beyond work 'bring the feels'

Building Community for the sake of it's being Community might be wrong, just talk to people, go for lunch, discuss your ideas, and watch the community happen as a result.

Community begins with caring about people, a lot of enterprise tools are built around toxic patterns of silos.  Choose tools that encourage open communication.

'Context setting' and 'Moddeling' Make safe spaces for teams to make decisiosn they think managers control. 

Community comes down basic human needs - listen!

How do you build a space where it's okay to tell someone how you feel about what's going on
+ Be honest about your own mistakes - especially if you are in an authortive position.
+ Vulnrability about work issue can help make a sapfe space for personal vulnrablity
+ Look for the intent behind the words - don't assume malace

It takes time.

Vocab - 'I need' vs 'lets get this done'

Bring a college to an external community

Josh - incremental change, make changes small
Naomi - meet new groups, lunch in conference rooms.
Christine - people have more than 

Teams need to help adopt tools.
Formal Community stuff doesn't work

Patterns and practices for building community.
  Weekly demo day 5 minutes - with incredibly supportive atmosphere.\
 
  Doug - starts with caring about people.  Tools built around toxic silo'd structure. Anti-community is the formal process and queues.  Office hours as a good thing.  Chef room with hip chat to ask questions.
   
  Daniel - responsibility without authority.  Jessica response - post it notes for everything. Open communication.
  Context settings and modelling - team takes ownership, how to get this to happen.  Dealt with breaking safety rules.  
   
Building a community - basic needs, safe, listened to, good for culture.
